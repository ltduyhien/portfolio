  "summary": "Nokia, a global leader in telecommunications and networking, partnered with Elisa, a major Finnish telecom operator, to deliver advanced subscription-based solutions. As Elisa expanded its enterprise services, managing complex pricing structures and generating accurate invoices became increasingly challenging. Manual workflows were error-prone and time-consuming, leading to billing disputes and delayed revenue recognition.\n\nNokia launched a pricing tool project to automate pricing and streamline invoicing. The solution brought clarity, speed, and scalability to billing operations, strengthening Nokia's value to clients like Elisa through a more efficient and transparent experience.",
  "problem": "- **Complex Product Configurations & Frequent Data Updates**  \nNokia's telecom offerings include highly interdependent components (e.g., radio units, basebands, licensing models). Product catalogs, pricing tiers, and discount rules change frequently, requiring the CPQ system to adapt rapidly and maintain accuracy.\n\n- **Limited Visualization and Insights**  \nExisting systems showed raw pricing data without visuals to highlight trends or anomalies, making quick interpretation tough. While the CPQ platform collects rich data, it lacks analysis and recommendations, a clear future enhancement opportunity.\n\n- **Manual and Error-Prone Workflows**  \nPrior to this solution, invoice generation relied on spreadsheets and fragmented processes, leading to delays, billing inaccuracies, and time-consuming dispute resolution.\n\n- **Compliance and Auditability**  \nInvoices needed to meet strict legal, tax, and auditing standards across different countries, requiring features like traceable calculation logic, version control, and PDF exports with precise formatting.\n\n- **Demand for Automation and Integration**  \nSales teams wanted integration with existing CRM and ERP systems to enable automation of quote generation and order processing. Without proper integration, seamless workflows and extensibility were limited.",
  "collaboration": "- **Work in Designer Team of** 3  \nCollaborated closely with the Design System team to ensure consistency and scalability across the platform. Regular design reviews and shared component libraries enabled rapid iteration while maintaining visual coherence.\n\n- **Regular Sync and workshop with Software Architect and project manager**  \nMaintained regular syncs and workshops with the Software Architect, Engineers, and Project Manager to ensure technical feasibility and business alignment. This collaborative approach fostered shared understanding and accelerated decision-making processes.\n\n- **User research and feedback integration**  \nConducted extensive user research with Nokia's sales teams and Sale Managers to understand their pricing workflows and pain points. Regular user testing sessions and feedback loops ensured the solution addressed real user needs and improved adoption rates.",
  "keyDecisions": "- **AI-Powered Pricing Insights**  \nDesigned intelligent analytics capabilities that analyze historical pricing data, market trends, and customer behavior to provide proactive pricing suggestions and identify optimization opportunities.\n\n- **Product Configuration Management**  \nEnabled organizing products into groups for easier, scalable pricing and policy enforcement.\n\n- **Sales Performance Tracking and Visualization**  \nImplemented detailed tracking and visual reporting of sales trends to support informed business decision-making.\n\n- **Configuration Assistant**  \nDesigned a system that suggests compatible products and validates configurations based on business rules.\n\n- **AI-Driven Pricing Recommendations**  \nImplemented machine learning algorithms that analyze past deals, customer profiles, and market conditions to suggest optimal pricing strategies and improve win rates.",
  "aiDesignMethodology": "**AI Design Methodology & Data Collection Approach**\n\nSmart automation powers the CPQ platform, turning complex pricing challenges into revenue-generating opportunities. Our AI capabilities boost sales performance through intelligent product suggestions, dynamic pricing strategies, and proactive error detection.\n\n**Data Collection Strategy:**\n\n- **Sales Performance Analytics:** Analyzed historical deal data, win/loss ratios, and customer conversion patterns to identify high-performing pricing strategies\n- **Market Segment Profiling:** Collected pricing intelligence from different customer segments and competitive landscapes to establish market-based pricing models\n- **Sales Workflow Analysis:** Studied how sales teams interact with pricing tools and which recommendation patterns lead to successful deal closures\n- **Product Portfolio Optimization:** Evaluated which product combinations and discount structures maximize deal profitability and customer satisfaction\n\n**AI Feature Design Process:**\n\n- **Deal Success Pattern Recognition:** Implemented machine learning algorithms to identify pricing patterns that consistently result in higher deal values and faster sales cycles\n- **Adaptive Pricing Intelligence:** Developed dynamic algorithms that adjust pricing recommendations based on customer profile, deal complexity, and market dynamics\n- **Smart Configuration Engine:** Built intelligent systems that suggest optimal product combinations and pricing strategies based on proven successful historical cases\n- **Sales Team Integration:** Established continuous feedback loops with sales teams to refine AI suggestions and enhance recommendation accuracy\n\n**Validation & Testing:**\n\n- **Sales Scenario Validation:** Conducted comprehensive testing of AI pricing strategies through realistic deal simulations across diverse customer segments and deal complexities\n- **Business Performance Tracking:** Monitored recommendation adoption rates, deal win rates, and average deal values to measure AI effectiveness and business impact",
  "outcomes": "The CPQ Pricing Tool changed how Nokia's charging department works. Within the first 4 months, quote generation time dropped significantly, and pricing managers reported fewer pricing errors. The automated validation helped teams spot incompatible product combinations faster than manual checking.\n\n**Business Impact:**\n\n- **Reduced Quote Generation Time:** Pricing teams could generate complex quotes more efficiently, compared to **2-3 hours** with manual processes (measured by tracking quote creation time before and after implementation)\n\n- **Improved Pricing Accuracy:** Significant reduction in pricing errors and billing disputes, with automated validation catching configuration issues before submission (based on error tracking and customer feedback)\n\n- **Enhanced Deal Velocity:** Increase in deal closure rates, with faster quote turnaround times and improved customer satisfaction (measured by comparing deal cycle times)\n\n- **Streamlined Integration:** Several enterprise customers successfully integrated the CPQ platform with their existing CRM systems, reducing manual data entry significantly (measured by tracking data entry time)\n\n**Testing & Validation Results:**\n\n**Prototype Testing:** Usability tests with pricing managers across **3 enterprise customers and 20+ sales representatives** confirmed the drag-and-drop interface reduced training time compared to previous spreadsheet-based methods.",
