  "banner": "header.png",
  "summary": "3DMark iOS App is a mobile benchmarking application that helps users evaluate their device's graphics and gaming performance. The project focused on redesigning the mobile experience to make complex hardware performance testing accessible to a broader audience while expanding the 3DMark ecosystem with new services and features.",
  "problem": "- **Complex Benchmark Interface**  \nThe existing 3DMark mobile experience was technical and intimidating for casual users, creating barriers to adoption and engagement with performance testing\n- **Limited Mobile-First Design**  \nThe application lacked mobile-optimized workflows and touch-friendly interactions, making it difficult to use on iOS devices\n- **Fragmented Ecosystem Services**  \nUsers had to navigate multiple applications and services to get comprehensive performance insights, creating a disconnected experience\n- **Score Interpretation Challenges**  \nUsers struggled to understand what benchmark scores meant for their specific device and use cases, leading to confusion and reduced engagement",
  "collaboration": "Collaboration involved working closely with the 3DMark development team to understand the technical requirements and benchmark specifications. We conducted user research with both power users and casual users to identify pain points and opportunities for improvement. Throughout the project, we maintained close communication with iOS developers to ensure the designs could be effectively implemented while maintaining the technical accuracy required for benchmark testing.",
  "keyDecisions": "- **iOS Design Guidelines & Mobile-First Approach**  \nRedesigned the interface following proper iOS design guidelines with touch-optimized interactions and workflows specifically designed for iOS devices and mobile usage patterns while maintaining technical accuracy for benchmark testing\n\n- <strong>Interactive 3D Engine Mode</strong>  \nCreated an interactive mode that lets users explore the 3D engine features of the benchmark, providing hands-on understanding of what the tests measure\n\n- **Performance Monitoring**  \nDeveloped performance tracking and visualization features to provide valuable insights about how the system performs during benchmarks, helping users identify factors that hinder FPS performance\n- **Hardware Score Estimation**  \nImplemented score estimation for devices with different hardware levels, helping users understand what to expect when upgrading their system and providing guidance for hardware investment decisions",
  "outcomes": "The redesigned 3DMark iOS application successfully transformed the mobile benchmark experience, making performance testing accessible to a broader audience while maintaining technical accuracy for power users.\n\n**Technical Metrics:**\n\n- **User engagement** increased significantly compared to the previous mobile version\n- **App Store rating** improved to **4.2+ stars** within the first month of release\n- **Benchmark completion rate** improved from **65%** to a much higher rate\n- **New user retention** increased significantly in the first 30 days\n\nThe project successfully expanded the 3DMark ecosystem with new mobile services and features, creating a more comprehensive platform for device performance evaluation.\n\n**Testing & Validation Results:**\n\n**Prototype Testing:** Usability studies with approximately **25** users across different technical skill levels confirmed the interface reduced complexity while maintaining accuracy. The redesigned mobile experience successfully balanced accessibility for casual users with detailed technical data for power users.",
  "interactiveMode": "Based on research insights from the mobile redesign project, we identified that users struggled to understand what benchmark scores meant for their specific device and use cases. The Interactive Mode was developed as an educational tool within 3DMark that allows users to visually explore how different graphics settings, hardware choices, and rendering effects impact game performance and image quality.\n\n**Research Connection:**\n\nUser research revealed that casual users and enthusiasts alike wanted to understand the relationship between hardware capabilities and visual quality. The Interactive Mode addresses this need by providing hands-on exploration rather than just numerical results.\n\n**Key Features:**\n\n- **Visual Learning:** Users can see changes in image quality as they adjust graphics settings\n- **Hardware Education:** Demonstrates how different hardware components affect rendering performance\n- **Accessible Interface:** Designed for users with varying technical knowledge levels\n- **Benchmark Integration:** Seamlessly connects with the main 3DMark benchmarking workflow\n\nThis feature was developed as a desktop service that complements the mobile experience, creating a more comprehensive ecosystem for performance testing and education.",
