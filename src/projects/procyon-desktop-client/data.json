  "summary": "The Procyon Desktop Client is a cross-platform benchmarking application that provides comprehensive performance testing for Windows and macOS systems. The application enables users to run standardized benchmark tests, analyze performance data, and generate detailed reports for hardware evaluation and optimization.\n\nThis project focused on modernizing the user interface and user experience of the Procyon benchmark suite, making complex performance testing accessible to both technical professionals and casual users. The design prioritized clarity, efficiency, and cross-platform consistency while maintaining the technical accuracy required for professional benchmarking.",
  "problem": "- **Complex Benchmark Interface**  \nThe existing Procyon desktop experience was technical and intimidating for casual users, creating barriers to adoption and engagement with performance testing. The interface lacked clear visual hierarchy and intuitive navigation.\n\n- **Limited Cross-Platform Consistency**  \nThe application needed to work seamlessly across Windows and macOS while maintaining platform-specific design guidelines and user expectations. Existing implementations had inconsistent UI patterns between platforms.\n\n- **Poor Data Visualization**  \nUsers struggled to understand benchmark results and performance trends. The interface showed raw data without effective visualizations to highlight key insights and comparisons.\n\n- **Fragmented User Workflow**  \nThe benchmarking process involved multiple disconnected steps: test selection, configuration, execution, and result analysis. Users needed a streamlined workflow that guided them through the entire process.",
  "collaboration": "Collaboration involved working closely with the Procyon development team to understand the technical requirements and benchmark specifications. We conducted user research with both power users and casual users to identify pain points and opportunities for improvement.\n\nTo reach our target users, we contacted them through multiple channels including Steam, Reddit, and our existing user database. This multi-channel approach allowed us to gather insights from diverse user segments - from hardcore gaming enthusiasts on Steam to casual users on Reddit, and existing Procyon users in our database.\n\nThroughout the project, we maintained close communication with desktop developers to ensure the designs could be effectively implemented while maintaining the technical accuracy required for benchmark testing. Regular design reviews and technical feasibility sessions helped bridge the gap between user experience goals and technical implementation constraints.",
  "keyDecisions": "The research revealed specific pain points that guided our technical decisions.\n\n- **Cross-Platform Design System**  \nUsers needed consistent experience across Windows and macOS. We developed a unified design system that respects platform conventions while maintaining brand consistency\n- **Intuitive Test Selection**  \nUsers struggled to choose appropriate benchmarks. We created a guided test selection interface with clear descriptions and use case recommendations\n- **Real-Time Performance Monitoring**  \nUsers wanted to see live performance data during tests. We implemented real-time monitoring with visual feedback and progress indicators\n- **Comprehensive Result Analysis**  \nUsers needed better ways to understand their results. We designed detailed result views with comparative analysis and performance insights\n- **Streamlined Workflow**  \nUsers wanted a simpler benchmarking process. We created a step-by-step wizard that guides users from test selection to result analysis",
