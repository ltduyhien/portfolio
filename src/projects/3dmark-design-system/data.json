  "Principles": "**Design Philosophy & Core Principles**\n\nOur design system is built on seven core principles that emerged from collaborative workshops with product managers, engineers, and designers. These principles guide every design decision and ensure our system serves both technical experts and newcomers to benchmarking.\n\n**1. Accessible by Default**\nWe ensure inclusive design for all users by supporting keyboard navigation, screen readers, and high contrast modes. Complex technical data is presented with simple, structured explanations, especially for newcomers. The system supports language localization and provides meaningful fallback flows across platforms. UIs are designed to be self-evident, reducing cognitive load for both benchmarking newcomers and professionals.\n\n**2. Optimized for 3D Content**\n3D graphics and micro-animations are integrated as part of the experience, not decoration. They communicate meaning like progress or GPU load. We maintain high frame rates in UI environments with 3D elements and use motion and visual hierarchy to elevate technical storytelling, especially in result visualization.\n\n**3. Unified, Yet Platform-Appropriate**\nWe create a consistent core visual language (components, typography, color system) that adapts appropriately to Web, Mobile, and Desktop platforms. Native design conventions are respected where necessary: touch gestures on mobile, mouse/keyboard affordances on desktop. Patterns align while allowing UI shape to reflect context.\n\n**4. User-Centered Benchmarking**\nGuidance is prioritized through onboarding flows, tooltips, and suggestions based on hardware or usage patterns. We provide comparisons, historical context, and educational layers to empower decision-making. Contextual personalization and memory features are offered, like last used benchmark or comparison history.\n\n**5. Transparent and Trustworthy**\nData trustworthiness is ensured through transparent result reporting, historical context, and recovery options after failed runs. We minimize unnecessary user friction with fast-loading interfaces and clear system state feedback. Result-sharing is made seamless and meaningful through visuals, exports, and social sharing tools.\n\n**6. Forward-Looking**\nThe system is designed with future-proofing in mind, supporting emerging use cases like AI benchmarking, hybrid workloads, or cloud streaming. It's modular, flexible, and adaptable for upcoming hardware and test types. Hooks are provided for live events, online competitions, or educational gamification to support evolving user engagement modes.\n\n**7. Delight Through Polish**\nThe premium nature of 3DMark is reflected through refined UI motion, clean layouts, and professional tone. Performance is maintained across all devices: no UI lag, no jank, smooth animations. Achievements are celebrated through micro-interactions, badges, scoreboards, and sharable results.",
  "Fundamental": "**Core Design Tokens & Foundational Elements**\n\nDesign tokens form the atomic foundation of our system, ensuring consistency across all platforms. We chose the Design Token Format (DTF) approach for its cross-platform compatibility and developer-friendly structure.\n\n**Why DTF for 3DMark:**\n\nOur multi-platform ecosystem (web, iOS, Android, macOS, Windows, Linux) requires a naming convention that translates seamlessly across all environments. DTF's dot notation provides clear hierarchical structure while maintaining platform-agnostic semantics. The format works excellently with design token tools like Style Dictionary and Theo, making it easy for our development teams to parse and transform tokens for different platforms.\n\n**Token Examples:**\n\n```\ncolor.primary.500\ncolor.neutral.100\nspacing.xs\nspacing.sm\ntypography.heading.1\ntypography.body.regular\nborder.radius.sm\nshadow.elevation.1\n```\n\n**Platform Conversions:**\n\n**Web:**\n```css\n--color-primary-500\n```\n**iOS:**\n```swift\nUIColor(designToken: \"color.primary.500\")\n```\n**Android:**\n```xml\n@color/primary_500\n```\n**macOS:**\n```swift\nNSColor(designToken: \"color.primary.500\")\n```\n**Windows:**\n```csharp\nColor.FromDesignToken(\"color.primary.500\")\n```\n\nThis approach provides a single source of truth that scales across our entire product ecosystem while maintaining clear semantic meaning for all teams.",
  "Accessibility": "**WCAG Guidelines & Accessibility Standards**\n\nAccessibility is not an afterthought but a core requirement of our design system. These standards are fundamental UX principles that ensure inclusive experiences for all users. Additionally, 3DMark follows UL Solutions design system requirements, which have strict accessibility standards that we must adhere to across all products.\n\n**Color & Contrast:**\n- All color combinations meet WCAG 2.1 AA contrast ratios\n- Color is never the only way to convey information\n- Focus states are clearly visible and distinct\n\n**Typography & Readability:**\n- Minimum font sizes for readability\n- Adequate line spacing and letter spacing\n- High contrast text on backgrounds\n- Scalable text that works with browser zoom\n\n**Keyboard Navigation:**\n- All interactive elements are keyboard accessible\n- Logical tab order through components\n- Clear focus indicators\n- Skip links for complex interfaces\n\n**Screen Reader Support:**\n- Semantic HTML structure\n- Proper ARIA labels and roles\n- Alternative text for images\n- Descriptive link text\n\n**Motion & Animation:**\n- Respect user's motion preferences\n- Provide pause/stop controls for animations\n- Ensure animations don't cause seizures\n- Clear loading states and progress indicators",
