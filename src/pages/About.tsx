            I am a Senior Product Designer with over 13 years of experience in SaaS and technical
            products, based in Espoo, Finland. My journey started with coding and evolved into
            design when I realized I could bridge the gap between technical complexity and user
            needs. My work focuses on turning complex technical systems into intuitive digital
            experiences that drive real business outcomes.
          </p>
          <p className="text-base font-medium text-zinc-700 dark:text-zinc-200 leading-relaxed">
            My background in software development gives me a unique perspective on product design.
            Having written code and built systems myself, I understand the technical constraints and
            possibilities that developers face. This knowledge helps me create designs that are not
            only user-friendly but also technically feasible and maintainable. When I design
            interfaces for complex systems, I can anticipate implementation challenges and work
            closely with engineering teams to find practical solutions that balance user needs with
            technical requirements.
