The project focused on redesigning the mobile experience to make complex hardware performance testing accessible to a broader audience while expanding the 3DMark ecosystem with new services and features.",a=`- **Complex Benchmark Interface**  
The existing 3DMark mobile experience was technical and intimidating for casual users, creating barriers to adoption and engagement with performance testing
- **Limited Mobile-First Design**  
The application lacked mobile-optimized workflows and touch-friendly interactions, making it difficult to use on iOS devices
- **Fragmented Ecosystem Services**  
Users had to navigate multiple applications and services to get comprehensive performance insights, creating a disconnected experience
- **Score Interpretation Challenges**  
Users struggled to understand what benchmark scores meant for their specific device and use cases, leading to confusion and reduced engagement`,r="Collaboration involved working closely with the 3DMark development team to understand the technical requirements and benchmark specifications. We conducted user research with both power users and casual users to identify pain points and opportunities for improvement. Throughout the project, we maintained close communication with iOS developers to ensure the designs could be effectively implemented while maintaining the technical accuracy required for benchmark testing.",s=`- **iOS Design Guidelines & Mobile-First Approach**  
Redesigned the interface following proper iOS design guidelines with touch-optimized interactions and workflows specifically designed for iOS devices and mobile usage patterns while maintaining technical accuracy for benchmark testing
- **New Ecosystem Services**  
Designed new services within the 3DMark ecosystem, including web services that allow users to compare their results and find meaningful insights about their scores and hardware performance
- <strong>Interactive 3D Engine Mode</strong>  
Created an interactive mode that lets users explore the 3D engine features of the benchmark, providing hands-on understanding of what the tests measure
- **Progressive Disclosure**  
Implemented a tiered information architecture that shows basic results to casual users while providing detailed technical data to power users
- **Performance Monitoring**  
Developed performance tracking and visualization features to make benchmark results more engaging and informative`,o=`The redesigned 3DMark iOS application successfully transformed the mobile benchmark experience, making performance testing accessible to a broader audience while maintaining technical accuracy for power users.

**Technical Metrics:**

- **User engagement** increased significantly compared to the previous mobile version
- **App Store rating** improved to **4.2+ stars** within the first month of release
- **Benchmark completion rate** improved from **65%** to a much higher rate
- **New user retention** increased significantly in the first 30 days

The project successfully expanded the 3DMark ecosystem with new mobile services and features, creating a more comprehensive platform for device performance evaluation.

**Testing & Validation Results:**

**Prototype Testing:** Usability studies with approximately **25** users across different technical skill levels confirmed the interface reduced complexity while maintaining accuracy. The redesigned mobile experience successfully balanced accessibility for casual users with detailed technical data for power users.`,c=`Based on research insights from the mobile redesign project, we identified that users struggled to understand what benchmark scores meant for their specific device and use cases. The Interactive Mode was developed as an educational tool within 3DMark that allows users to visually explore how different graphics settings, hardware choices, and rendering effects impact game performance and image quality.

**Research Connection:**

User research revealed that casual users and enthusiasts alike wanted to understand the relationship between hardware capabilities and visual quality. The Interactive Mode addresses this need by providing hands-on exploration rather than just numerical results.

**Key Features:**

- **Visual Learning:** Users can see changes in image quality as they adjust graphics settings
- **Hardware Education:** Demonstrates how different hardware components affect rendering performance
- **Accessible Interface:** Designed for users with varying technical knowledge levels
- **Benchmark Integration:** Seamlessly connects with the main 3DMark benchmarking workflow

This feature was developed as a desktop service that complements the mobile experience, creating a more comprehensive ecosystem for performance testing and education.`,d=[{image:"prototype1.png",caption:"A clean home screen guides users through benchmark onboarding while displaying their device information"},{image:"prototype2.png",caption:"Users can compare their device performance with others, export detailed reports, and select which devices to benchmark against"},{image:"prototype3.png",caption:"Results are displayed in a clear list format with filtering options to help users find and understand their benchmark data"}],l=[{label:"Full Research Report",url:"#"},{label:"User Flows",url:"#"},{label:"Interactive Prototype",url:"#"}],h="Project Length: **14 Months**",p="**Senior Product Designer**",m=["iOS","Benchmark","Hardware","Gaming"],u="3DMark iOS App",g=`- User research with benchmark users across different technical skill levels
