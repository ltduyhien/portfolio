const e="Cloud-based platform for automated PC performance testing and monitoring.",n="Test Driver Cloud at UL Solutions (Former Futuremark)",t="/projects/test-driver-cloud",a="header.png",i=`UL Solutions, a global leader in safety science and testing, provides trusted benchmarks and performance standards that help organizations make informed decisions about technology investments. Their benchmark tools, including PCMark and 3DMark, are industry standards used by millions of users worldwide to evaluate system performance and reliability.

Test Driver Cloud (TDC) is a B2B SaaS platform designed for enterprise IT administrators to run and manage benchmark tests remotely. It streamlines performance monitoring across large device fleets by automating test execution and result collection through the cloud. The platform helps organizations boost operational efficiency, reduce manual overhead, and gain deeper visibility into system health at scale.`,s=`- **Complex Hardware Performance Monitoring**  
Enterprise IT teams needed to monitor performance across hundreds of devices with different hardware configurations, operating systems, and usage patterns. Manual benchmarking processes were time-consuming and error-prone, requiring significant technical expertise.
- **Limited Visualization and Insights**  
Existing benchmarking systems showed raw benchmark scores without visuals to highlight trends or anomalies, making quick interpretation tough. While TDC collects rich data, it lacks analysis and recommendations, a clear future enhancement opportunity.
- **Manual and Fragmented Workflow**  
Benchmarking involves many manual steps: configuring tests, managing schedules, collecting results, and analyzing data. This fragmented approach created bottlenecks and made it difficult to scale across large device fleets.
- **Limited Integration and Automation**  
IT teams wanted integration with existing monitoring and reporting systems to enable automated workflows and centralized result retrieval. Without API access, seamless integration and extensibility were limited.`,r=`**Onboarding new joiners while maintaining delivery speed**  
The TDC team was composed of a designer, back-end developer, front-end developer, and product manager. While the team had strong domain knowledge in SaaS and benchmarking, a few members were newly onboarded. Ensuring they ramped up quickly without slowing progress required focused knowledge transfer, clear communication, and tight collaboration from the start.`,o=`- **Hardware Health Insights**  
Prioritized future capabilities to analyze benchmark results and provide proactive hardware health suggestions.
- **Device Group Management**  
Enabled organizing devices into groups for easier, scalable benchmarking and policy enforcement.
- **API Design and Integration**  
Built a flexible API to support integration with existing IT tools and enable automation of benchmarking workflows.
- **Performance Tracking and Visualization**  
Implemented detailed tracking and visual reporting of performance trends to support informed IT decision-making.
- **Performance Monitoring System**  
Designed a system that identifies unusual performance patterns and flags potential hardware issues.
- **Maintenance Planning Features**  
Implemented a system that tracks performance degradation trends to help plan maintenance schedules.`,d=`The Test Driver Cloud platform improved how enterprise IT teams handle performance monitoring. Within the first 6 months, active users grew significantly compared to manual benchmarking, with IT administrators spending less time on performance testing while achieving better accuracy in identifying hardware issues.

**Business Impact:**

- **Reduced Manual Overhead:** IT teams could manage benchmark testing across hundreds of devices from a single dashboard, reducing manual intervention (measured by comparing time spent on manual vs. automated processes)
- **Improved Performance Visibility:** Monitoring enabled proactive issue detection, reducing mean time to resolution (based on incident response time tracking)
- **Enhanced Integration:** API access allowed non-technical stakeholders to access performance insights through familiar business intelligence platforms

API integrations enabled several enterprise customers to automate their performance monitoring workflows, with webhook notifications reducing response time to performance issues from hours to minutes. User satisfaction scores improved from **3.3 to ~3.7** (measured via quarterly user surveys), with particular praise for the intuitive device management interface and performance insights.

**Testing & Validation Results:**

**Prototype Testing:** Usability tests with IT administrators confirmed the interface reduced training time compared to previous manual methods. Data collected across **15+ enterprise customers and 40+ IT administrators** through automated tracking, user surveys, and performance monitoring systems.`,c=[{image:"prototype-device-manage.png",caption:"IT administrators can manage their device fleet and schedule benchmark tests across multiple machines from a single interface"},{image:"prototype-device-performance-ai.png",caption:"Performance insights help identify anomalies and provide recommendations for hardware health"},{image:"prototype-schedule.png",caption:"Automated test scheduling lets teams set up recurring benchmarks and view results in an organized timeline"}],l=[{label:"Full Research Report",url:"#"},{label:"User Flows",url:"#"},{label:"Interactive Prototype",url:"#"}],m="Project Length: **12 Months**",u="**Senior Product Designer**",p=["Enterprise","B2B","Benchmark","AI","SaaS"],g="Test Driver Cloud",h=`- Heuristic evaluation of existing tools

We designed these features with a focus on practical IT operations rather than AI for its own sake.

**Performance Monitoring System:**
- Provides visual alerts when performance metrics fall outside normal ranges
- Uses configurable thresholds to flag potential hardware issues
- Helps IT teams identify devices that need attention

**Maintenance Planning Features:**
- Tracks performance trends over time to identify degradation patterns
- Provides recommendations based on historical maintenance data
- Helps IT teams plan maintenance schedules more effectively

**Performance Optimization Suggestions:**
- Compares device performance against similar configurations
- Suggests settings based on successful setups in the organization
- Helps IT teams optimize system performance based on best practices

These features were designed with input from IT administrators and system engineers, ensuring they address real operational needs rather than being technology-driven solutions.`,b=`To support enterprise IT administrators in managing performance data across their fleet, we designed and documented a RESTful API that exposes system telemetry, benchmark results, and configuration metadata from Test Driver Cloud. This enables organizations to integrate Test Driver insights directly into their own internal dashboards, asset management systems, or automation workflows.

**Key Features:**

- **Secure Access:** API authentication via organization-level API keys with role-based access controls
- **Flexible Querying:** Support for filtering by device ID, user, time range, benchmark type, or performance threshold
- **Webhook Support:** For notifications when test results exceed or fall below pre-defined thresholds
- **Export Ready:** JSON and CSV response formats for compatibility with third-party tools (e.g., Power BI, Splunk)

**Integration Capabilities:**

The API provides comprehensive access to benchmark data and system metrics, including:

- Fetching benchmark results for individual devices or device groups
- Filtering results by time range, benchmark type, or performance thresholds
- Exporting data in multiple formats for external analysis
- Setting up webhook notifications for performance alerts
- Integrating with business intelligence and monitoring platforms

**Enterprise Integration:**

The API was designed to integrate with existing enterprise infrastructure, including:

- Asset management systems and device inventories
- Performance monitoring and alerting platforms
- Business intelligence and reporting tools
- IT automation and workflow systems
- Compliance and audit reporting systems`,v={title:e,subtext:n,path:t,banner:a,summary:i,problem:s,constraints:r,keyDecisions:o,outcomes:d,screenshots:c,appendices:l,timeSpent:m,role:u,industries:p,productName:g,ideation:h,ideationImages:f,aiFeatures:y,api:b};export{y as aiFeatures,b as api,l as appendices,a as banner,r as constraints,v as default,h as ideation,f as ideationImages,p as industries,o as keyDecisions,d as outcomes,t as path,s as problem,g as productName,u as role,c as screenshots,n as subtext,i as summary,m as timeSpent,e as title};
