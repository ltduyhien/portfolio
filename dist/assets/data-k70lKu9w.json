  "summary": "A comprehensive design system that establishes consistent design patterns, components, and guidelines across all products and platforms. This system serves as the foundation for creating cohesive user experiences while maintaining scalability and maintainability.\n\n**The Challenge:** Our 3DMark ecosystem spans multiple platforms and user typesâ€”mobile apps on Android and iOS, web platforms serving both B2C and B2B users, and desktop applications across macOS, Windows, and expanding to Linux. This multi-platform complexity created inconsistent user experiences, redundant development work, and growing maintenance overhead.\n\n**The Solution:** A unified design system that provides standardized components, patterns, and guidelines. This system ensures consistency across all 3DMark products while enabling faster development cycles, better collaboration between teams, and improved accessibility standards. By establishing a shared design language, we've created a scalable foundation that supports our growing ecosystem while maintaining the high-quality user experience our users expect.",
  "problem": "**Inconsistent Design Patterns & Scalability Challenges**\n\nOur product portfolio had grown significantly, with multiple teams working on different features and platforms. This led to:\n\n- **Inconsistent UI patterns** across different products and features\n- **Duplicated design work** as teams created similar components independently\n- **Maintenance overhead** when design changes needed to be applied across multiple products\n- **Poor developer experience** with no standardized component library\n- **Accessibility gaps** due to inconsistent implementation of design patterns\n\nWe needed a centralized design system that would provide consistent, reusable components while maintaining flexibility for different use cases.",
  "constraints": "**Technical & Business Constraints**\n\n**Platform Diversity:** The design system needed to work across web, mobile, and desktop applications with different technical requirements.\n\n**Team Collaboration:** Multiple design and development teams needed to contribute to and use the system effectively.\n\n**Performance Requirements:** Components needed to be lightweight and performant across all platforms.\n\n**Accessibility Standards:** Full WCAG 2.1 AA compliance was required for all components.\n\n**Backward Compatibility:** Existing products needed to be gradually migrated without breaking changes.\n\n**Documentation Needs:** Comprehensive documentation was essential for adoption across teams.",
  "keyDecisions": [
    "**Component-First Architecture:** Built the system around reusable, composable components rather than page templates",
    "**Design Token Foundation:** Established a comprehensive design token system for colors, typography, spacing, and other design values",
