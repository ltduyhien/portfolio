The project focused on improving development velocity, application performance, and maintainability while preserving all existing functionality.",r=`- **Complex Multi-Technology Architecture**  
The existing Procyon Windows client used a hybrid approach with Chromium UI wrapping a Java backend server and RiotJS frontend, creating significant development bottlenecks and performance issues.

- **Slow Development Velocity**  
The complex technology stack required developers to work across multiple languages and frameworks, leading to longer development cycles and increased debugging complexity.

- **Performance Bottlenecks**  
The hybrid architecture with multiple technology layers resulted in slow application startup times, memory overhead, and poor user experience during benchmark execution.

- **Maintenance Challenges**  
Maintaining and updating the application required coordination across multiple technology stacks, making bug fixes and feature additions time-consuming and error-prone.`,a=`- **Technology Stack Evaluation**  
Conducted comprehensive analysis of modern desktop application frameworks, evaluating ElectronJS and Flutter as potential replacements for the existing architecture.

- **Architecture Modernization**  
Proposed unified technology stack approach to eliminate the complexity of managing multiple technologies and improve development efficiency.

- **Performance Optimization Strategy**  
Designed new architecture focused on reducing startup times, memory usage, and improving overall application responsiveness.

- **Migration Planning**  
Developed phased migration strategy to ensure seamless transition while maintaining all existing Procyon benchmark functionality and user workflows.`,c=`- **Technology Stack Selection**  
Evaluated ElectronJS and Flutter as primary candidates, considering factors like development team expertise, performance requirements, and cross-platform capabilities.

- **Architecture Simplification**  
Decided to move away from the complex multi-technology approach to a unified, modern framework that would streamline development and improve performance.

- **Backward Compatibility Strategy**  
Planned migration approach to ensure all existing Procyon benchmark functionality and user workflows remain intact during the transition.

- **Performance Benchmarking**  
Established performance metrics and testing protocols to measure improvements in startup time, memory usage, and overall application responsiveness.

- **Development Workflow Optimization**  
Designed new development processes to improve team productivity and reduce time-to-market for new features and bug fixes.`,s=`- **Legacy System Integration**  
Ensured the new architecture could integrate with existing Procyon benchmark engines and backend systems without disrupting current functionality.

- **User Experience Continuity**  
Maintained familiar user interface and workflows to prevent disruption for existing Procyon users and customers.

- **Performance Requirements**  
Set strict performance benchmarks to ensure the new architecture would deliver measurable improvements over the existing implementation.

- **Development Timeline**  
Balanced the need for comprehensive modernization with business requirements for continued product development and customer support.`,m=`Procyon Windows Client Reinvention modernizes the benchmark suite architecture from a complex multi-technology stack to a unified, modern platform.
